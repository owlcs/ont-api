     * and, therefore, without the help of this method,
     * there is a danger of {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException} (at best),
     * if some processing go outside a method who spawned the stream, in spite of the dedicated lock-section.
     * So need to make sure stream is created from a snapshot state.
     * <p>
     * Notice that this class does not produce parallel streams.
     * It comes with danger live locks or even deadlocks while interacting with loading-caches,
     * since all of them are based on the standard Java {@code ConcurrentHashMap}.
