     * Answers whether an internal model content cache is enabled, that is {@code true} by default.
     * <p>
     * Disabling internal content cache may be useful in case the ontology is too large to fit in memory.
     * In the normal case, it is better not to turn off this cache.
     * <p>
     * An internal model content cache speedups axiom listing and controls add/remove components behaviour.
     * If it is turned off,
     * then the direct graph traversal is used for retrieving axioms and ontology header (annotations).
     * Warning: in that case, the adding and removing axioms is disabled in the model level.
     * For this, there are two reasons:
     * <ul>
     * <li>OWL-API allows some uncertainty in axiom's definition,
     * the same data amount can be represented as an axiom in various ways
     * (more about this see in the description of
     * the method {@link Ontology#clearCache()}).
     * It follows from this that the newly added axiom may not be found in the same form as it was,
     * which may confuse</li>
     * <li>Currently,
     * the {@link org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLOntology#removeAxiom(org.semanticweb.owlapi.model.OWLAxiom)}
     * operation requires some analytics to decide which part of an axiom can be really deleted from the graph,
     * which is also a consequence of OWL-API ambiguity.
     * This implies some calculations that may take a long time if there is no cache</li>
     * </ul>
     * But non-modifiability concerns only the top-level {@link Ontology OWL Model} interface.
     * If it is not restricted in some other place, a graph is editable.
     * So it is possible to modify model using {@link OntModel} interface
     * (see the method {@link Ontology#asGraphModel()}).
     * Also, to add axiom a {@link com.github.owlcs.ontapi.internal.AxiomTranslator} mechanism can be used,
     * e.g. to add the axiom {@code A} into the RDF Model {@code m},
     * the expression {@code AxiomParserProvider.get(A).writeAxiom(A, m)} can be used.
     * <p>
     * Also, please note: the cache ensures no duplicates in any {@code Stream}, returned by axioms-listing methods.
     * When the cache is disabled, this restriction is removed.
     * For example, the couple of triples {@code x owl:differentFrom y . y owl:differentFrom x}
     * will produce two identical (by {@code equals(Object)} and {@code hashCode()}) axioms.
