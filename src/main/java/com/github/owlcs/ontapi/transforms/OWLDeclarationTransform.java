/**
 * Class to perform the final tuning of the OWL-2 ontology: mostly for fixing missed owl-declarations where it is possible.
 * It has to be running after {@link RDFSTransform} and {@link OWLCommonTransform}.
 * <p>
 * This transformer is designed to put in order any external (mainly none-OWL2) ontologies.
 * Also, there are lots examples of incomplete or wrong ontologies provided by the tests from OWL-API contract pack,
 * which are not necessarily RDFS or OWL1.
 * And it seems such situations have to be relative rare in the real world, since
 * any API which meets specification would not produce ontologies, when there is some true parts of OWL2,
 * but no explicit declarations or some other components from which they consist.
 * At least one can be sure that ONT-API does not provide anything that only partially complies with the specification;
 * but for correct output the input should also be correct.
 * <p>
 * Consists of two inner transforms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first, {@link ManifestDeclarator}, works with the obvious cases
 * when the type of the left or the right statements part is defined by the predicate or from some other clear hints.
 * E.g. if we have triple "A rdfs:subClassOf B" then we know exactly - both "A" and "B" are owl-class expressions.
 * </li>
 * <li>The second, {@link ReasonerDeclarator}, performs iterative analyzing of whole graph to choose the correct entities type.
 * E.g. we can have owl-restriction (existential/universal quantification)
 * "_:x rdf:type owl:Restriction; owl:onProperty A; owl:allValuesFrom B",
 * where "A" and "B" could be either object property and class expressions or data property and data-range,
 * and therefore we need to find other entries of these two entities in the graph;
 * for this example the only one declaration either of "A" or "B" is enough.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
